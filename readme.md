# ICT-Y1P3-OOPD-Fruit-Catcher
The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible and get as many points as possible by catching different fruits (apple, watermelon, orange, banana) that fall down. The more points the player gets, the more difficult the game becomes. The player must be careful, in addition to the normal fruit objects, special objects also fall down that can affect or end the game. These special objects are made in the same way as the fruit. The game may also end if the player has been unable to collect too much fruit.

Game based upon the [OOPG](https://github.com/HANICA/oopg) game engine made in Eclipse.
